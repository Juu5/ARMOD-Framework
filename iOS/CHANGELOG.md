# Version 0.0.1
# Main features of ARMOD

## AR Basic
- Device tracking: track the device's position and orientation in physical space.
- Plane detection: detect horizontal and vertical surfaces.
- Point clouds, also known as feature points.
- Anchor: an arbitrary position and orientation that the device tracks.
- Light estimation: estimates for average color temperature and brightness in physical space.
- Environment probe: a means for generating a cube map to represent a particular area of the physical environment.
- Face tracking: detect and track human faces.
- 2D image tracking: detect and track 2D images.
- Human segmentation: determines a stencil texture and depth map of humans detected in the camera image.
- Raycast: queries physical surroundings for detected planes and feature points.
- Pass-through video: optimized rendering of mobile camera image onto touch screen as the background for AR content.
- Session management: manipulation of the platform-level configuration automatically when AR Features are enable or disabled.
- Occlusion: allows for occlusion of virtual content by detected environmental depth (environment occlusion) or by detected human depth (human occlusion).
## AR Cloud
- Fast visual positioning, low system overhead
- Positioning can be run offline on the device or online in the cloud
- Plug-ins on iOS, Android and devices compatible with Huawei AR Engine
- Immersal Cloud Service's REST API for any device
- Pre-built applications are available on the App Store to map real-world locations
- It can even map indoor and outdoor large urban areas
- Very small map file format, extremely optimized
- Private/public map with sharing options
- Global map coordination supports WGS84 and ECEF
- Use GPS coordinates to mark and search the map
- Textured mesh of point cloud and available mapping space
- Support multiple maps at the same time in the same space
- Easy-to-use Unity example with templates for indoor navigation and more
- Detailed documentation helps developers get started
- Use the 3D map viewer to develop the portal
